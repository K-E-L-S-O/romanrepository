        <h2><strong>A little bit about Myself:</strong></h2>
          <p>I moved from Florida to Minnesota with my wife to start a new adventure! It has been interesting so far but I am not a fan of the cold.</p>
        
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p><strong>Sound Design:</strong> I enjoy making sounds! I love making sample packs and dabbling inside of synths such as PhasePlant and Serum.</p>
          <p><strong>Learning to Code:</strong> I enjoy learning to code as well and hope to one day know full stack development to not only get a job in web 
            development but to create my own website.</p>
          <p><strong>3D Modelling:</strong> I have been messing inside of blender little by little to learn 3D modelling. It's not something I am completely focused 
        on but I think it'll be useful to know in the future especially for my website.</p>
